# Hanap

## 📌 Project Overview

**Hanap** is a simple web-based masterlist and role management system built to organize, store, and manage records for a specific group. The name _Hanap_ comes from the Filipino word for **“look”** or **“search”**, reflecting the app’s goal of making information easy to find and manage.

This project focuses on **core CRUD functionality** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) while keeping the system lightweight and beginner-friendly. It is built as a **learning-by-building project** rather than a tutorial-only exercise.
